Forest Cover Type Classification
Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end machine learning solution for predicting the forest cover type based on various environmental and geographical features. The analysis and model development are documented in the provided Jupyter Notebook, csv 1.ipynb.

The primary goal is to perform a multi-class classification to accurately predict the Cover_Type (the target variable) using several classification algorithms.

Data
The project uses a dataset loaded from a file named train.csv.

Size: 15,120 rows and 56 columns.

Target Variable: Cover_Type (an integer indicating the forest cover type).

Key Features: The features are a mix of continuous and binary-encoded variables, including:

Topographic features: Elevation, Aspect, Slope.

Distance features: Horizontal_Distance_To_Hydrology, Vertical_Distance_To_Hydrology, Horizontal_Distance_To_Roadways, Horizontal_Distance_To_Fire_Points.

Solar features: Hillshade_9am, Hillshade_Noon, Hillshade_3pm.

Categorical features (One-hot encoded): 4 binary columns for Wilderness_Area and 40 binary columns for Soil_Type (e.g., Soil_Type1 through Soil_Type40).

Installation and Dependencies
The following core Python libraries are required to run the Jupyter Notebook:

Data Handling: numpy, pandas

Visualization: matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn

Machine Learning (Scikit-learn):

StandardScaler for preprocessing

train_test_split for model validation

SelectKBest, f_classif for feature selection

Model Algorithms: LogisticRegression, SVC, RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier

Metrics: accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix

Model Persistence: joblib (used for saving the final model)

You can install the necessary dependencies using pip:

Bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn joblib
Project Workflow
The csv 1.ipynb notebook follows these steps:

Data Loading and Inspection: Load train.csv and check for missing values or incorrect data types using df.info().

Feature Engineering & Scaling: Standard Scaling is applied to the numeric features for consistent range.

Feature Selection: The SelectKBest technique with f_classif is used to identify and select the most important features, preparing the data for the classifiers.

Model Training and Evaluation: Multiple classification models are trained and evaluated on the test set.

Best Model Selection and Saving: The best-performing model is selected and saved to a file using joblib for later use.

Models and Results
Four classification models were tested:

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

RandomForest Classifier

Gradient Boosting Classifier

The results of the evaluation showed the following best performance:

Metric	Best Result	Model
Accuracy	0.8647	RandomForest
The RandomForest model was identified as the best-performing classifier for this dataset. The model is saved as 'RandomForest_best_model.pkl'.
